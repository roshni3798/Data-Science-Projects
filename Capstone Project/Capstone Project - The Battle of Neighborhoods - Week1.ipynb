    "### Background & Problem\n",
    "Portugal's housing prices continue to rise strongly, fuelled by surging demand and improved economic conditions. Based on figures released by Statistics Portugal (INE), in Lisbon metropolitan area, property prices were up by 7.9% (7.2% in real terms) in 2018 from a year earlier, to an average of â‚¬1,502 per $m^2$.  \n",
    "With the Portuguese housing market expecting to remain buoyant this year, with Moody's Investors Service predicting house price increases of between 7% and 8% every year until 2020 and given the fact that restrictions on foreign property ownership in Portugal is non-existent, a preliminary study on the real state market is of interest.  \n",
    "In this report aims to present an overview of Lisbon neighbourhoods to aid on the decision of investing in real state in the city. This report aims to provide targeted information near the potential property to be sold through clustering and categorisation of living areas and identification of unique characteristics of that areas.\n"
